# Serial Port for Flutter

`flutter_libserialport` is a simple wrapper around the [`libserialport`](https://pub.dev/packages/libserialport)
Dart package, utilizing Flutter's build system to build and deploy the [libserialport](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Libserialport)
C-library under the hood. This package does not provide any additional API, but merely helps to make the `libserialport` Dart
package work "out of the box" without the need of manually building and deploying the `libserialport` C-library.

Supported platforms:
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
- Android

## Usage

To use this package, add `flutter_libserialport` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies).
